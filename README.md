The primary goal of this project is to create a deep network that can identify emotions in facial expressions. We will leverage the power of transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained models, and fine-tuning them on our facial emotions dataset.

# Facial Emotions Data 
The facial emotions data is from a Kaggle challenge i.e [Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data). The data is ```48*48``` pixel images containing facial emotions along with their emotion.
